<h1>Welcome to GZGHost</h1>
<p>A Game, disguised as a website</p>

<div class="container">

<div class="col-sm-4">
<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>This website, is really just one big puzzle. The goal of it is to get to the end,
plain and simple. Of course actually acomplishing that is a lot harder than it sounds,
but we will get to that later.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-4">
<h3>The Methods</h3>
<p>The way this puzzle works is all centered around certain keywords that you are tasked with finding. Then, you have to do something incredibly brilliant or intuitive with them (i.e. typing the keyword in the address bar or right clicking on it.) The keywords start out as fairly obvious, but they get harder as time goes on. Eventually they will no longer be outright said, rather you might have to infer them from some phrase on the page</p>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-4">
<h3>The Rules</h3>
<p>Now we have reached the part that everybody skips over, but bear with me because this helps make this experience the most fun it can possibly be. Rule number one is that if you happen to get to the end, do not post it anywhere online, or if you havent do not read any guide online, it takes the fun out of it. Rule number two is to not use any external website or application to find the website directory, because that also takes the fun out of it. Rule number three is less of a rule and more of a suggestion. Use Google Chrome</p>
